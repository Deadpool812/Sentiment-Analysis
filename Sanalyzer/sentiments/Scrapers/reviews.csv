Service within 24 hours from Online Order. Price is comparatively less than any other standard shopping app. The service man was polite and humble.Thanks Flipkart.
"PRO: Good battery, great display in the segment, phone feels good in hand, stock and clean android 10 no bloatware, moto gestures are awesome, buy it if you want good budget phone and you're more into multimedia"
Very good phone best price nice looking phone thank you ‚ò∫Ô∏è flipkart
Pros:
Pros - 
Excellent mobile at reasonable price with branded mobile with all features.Buy with confidence and enjoy the features of Motorola mobile..
"Excellent phone at this price range.... Recommend to buy.. Super features, good quality screen"
First of all thankyou flipkart for fast delevery in 24 hours. Staff is also polite and kind. 
"Don't go with mobile reviewers opinion. This mobile worth more than this price. Stock android experience, Great application of Google assistant key, superb battery back up, Superb built quality, Nice Audio quality as well as call quality. Good mobile at this price segment."
For medium user best mobile.
"Very nice mobile and I love it.  my mother purchased it and she is very happy with the product it gives you a long lasting battery ,very excellent camera and a  very good speaker for your mobile you will also get a nice back cover for it in the package."
It's a very powerful and clean phone. Useful for those who like pure android experience.
Awesome battery life. Worthy Phone..Not happy with front cam. But still a fine product in the budget.
"It has notification light!! camera isn't good enough but can't complaint on this price.. moto apps aren't there, yet chp chop and twist moto features are working.. best for light use. Not for heavy gamer, yet fifa 20 is working fine. orange color is better than blue. For old people it is best. üòÜ"
"Super phone , thank yu flipkart üòçü•∞"
Good
Lovely Phone
Thank You Flipkart..........Thanks Right time and genuine product delivered...........
Nice product
"I bought this phone on 10th March 2021 from Flipkart. The delivery was very fast and hassle free. Now about the phone, The blue colour which I ordered was nice. Good thing is that this phone is water resistant. The phone is a bit heavy and feels bulky. The phone has got good performance, thanks to 4GB of RAM, 64 GB internal storage and near stock android software with minimal bloatware running on December security patch, inspite of running on an entry level processor. The software updates are..."
I purchased this mobile on 7th May 2021 after a lot of thorough research depending upon my usage and I am really astonished to see the performance. 
"I am using this device as my secondary device and I am happy with performance. Clean user interface, no ads, no blotwares. I don't use camera that much as I mentioned it's not my primary but typing hepatic feelings is too good like flagship. Considering the price point it's very good device. I bought this with exchange with my three years old Nokia1 so it's felt very less for me."
Very nice moto mobile but processor G25 slowly Works battery good back up and camera look very nice Maine first day hi order diya..
"Worth the Money. In the Price range, It is the best. Camera suffers a bit during night but in day light it's fine. Good battery lasts more than a day for average usage. Performance is more than good (better). But we may able to see some lags for heavy usage as g25 is entry level processor. In normal usage, Not worries at all."
It's a good budget smartphone and excellent service by flipkart. But the exchange offer is not so good there is a very small dot in the screen even not visible by just a look heavy reduction in exchange price bit unexpected.
Bought the phone for my wife who was using a Asus earlier. It is large & heavy & OK for ladies who carry the phone in their purse / bag. To carry in trouser pocket or in hand will take some getting used to. 
A very good budget phone. Awesome in this range. I took it for my mother and I am very happy with the performance of the phone.
It's a good phone for the price. It's a bit bulky for my liking. I had a Nexus 5 before this so I can't compare it with the price. Overall it's good for basic everyday use and few games. Thanks for the fast delivery Flipkart. Awesome delivery time I got it in 2 days
Products are good I purchase simple use to home product and quality are best purchase and deal are correct  product....... So good product.
Looking good
Full on power üí™
Back camera
V good product and price
Everything is good but the phone is getting much heat while charging and the charger itself. Is that normal for this type of battery?
"Hello friends, I never reviewed a product before and this is my 1st review. To be frank I couldn't resist myself without reviewing this product."
Nice product
Hello motoüëåüèª
Camera is really awesome

Best Budget Fully Loaded Smart Phone

"Don't buy any product from Flipkart its bad experience with Flipkart. Motorola E7 power have lot of issue heating issue, camera not performing well, mobile always goes to hang mode untrusted device. Lot of mobile heating issue the temperature goes to upto 45 degree in offline mode."
A budgeted phone worth buying
Moto products is the best
This phone is very good at this price but Model and looks is not very good.
Best
Just awesome
Only one day use...Dont buy this mobile
Keeps hanging this phone.
Very disappointed with battery charging.
"Camera quality is very bad Front and back both  camera. Processor is slow, normal batary backup, waste of money...üò†üò†üò†üò†"
"Sound Qulity in not Good, & Sound is So Low. Battery is good, Model in look is good, Display is also good, But Camera & Sound is not Goo."
I am purchase Motorola E7 power my mobile is hanging problem and hot problem. I am trying to return my moto e7 power also reject my request
Battery ok
So nice üëçüëç

Awesome product
Good product
Always prefer motorola over all other...
"Pros: 4GB 64GB with improved storage tech, IP52 water resistant, MIMO tech for better calls quality, enough battery backup, type C, Finger unlock & lastly pure stock Android experience!"
I had purchased in a 1st sale of flipkart. and i giving reveiw after user of 10 day . Mototrola e 7 power Battery  is working good and Application opening time is average but camera is below average. 
Good Phone. Fast response. It has white notification light also.the screen is also large size. And totally happy with the performance. The sound is also big.
After using 1 week.....
"Good product this very very reasonable price on this product.good battery is absolutely better. I'm using one day full ihave use mobile data,wife, hotspot,but just reduce charge only 40% in one day full,i like this product.thank you moto."
I got this phone yesterday from flipkart 
Average phone in this Segment. Camera quality is not so good but battery life is very good. Display is average and you will dissapoint in high sunlight.You stage will do normal works but at a stage of high works it will lags.
Bought this for my dad. He liked the phone and the colour. It's not handy due to bigger screen size. The screen resolution is not the best as the ppi isn't that great. Performance is way too average but can't expect much though for the pricing. The camera could have been better. If using as a secondary phone can go for it as it has got good battery backup.
Mobile performance is very good in this price range
"Good phone, Suitable for general purpose  "

Best Phone First Time Use Motorola Mobile
"First of all battery is awesome, display wonderful overall fine. Drawback of  phone - camera is very poor, charger is of c type so no other charger can be used for charging, hybrid slot  so u cannot use 2 sim and 1 sd card  at same time. Over all phone at this price is awesome. Normal OTG also can't be used due to C type charger."
"Sound quality is not good, other wise üëåok in this price üôÇ"
"Application not working properly, display touch not working and after thatSpecifically Flipkart customer service is worst."

"At this price, this is a steal as it doesn't come with preloaded useless apps or bloatware.  I am not quite bit satisfied with the battery, which kind of lasts for a day after being fully charged and this is when, i don't play no games. It serves my basic functions quite well, so yeah if you are looking for a budget phone, go for it. In cricket analogy, think of this phone as Wriddhiman Saha. Good wicket keeper can bat too but well there is no flair."

Network issue.  Slow internet speed as compared to my old Samsung on 8 mobile.
Don't waste money really
Don't Buy this mobile. Totally wastage of money. If you think to buy before take feedback from someone who is using this mobile. Or self check it on your hand take from else who is user of this product.
This mobile is working very smooth and for professional use it's fentastic but camera lovers will disappoint. Regular YouTube and All other works performing perfectly.. gud net speed and battery performance is gud. If u r not a camera psycho. U can blindly choose this phone..
Working is good

GOOD MOBILE BUT ONLY PROBLEM  IN THIS MOBILE IS HYBRID SLOT. MOTOROLA SHOULD BE PROVIDE TWO SIM SLOT AND ONE SD CARD SLOT LIKE MOTO E5 PLUS .
Everything is ok only a single shortcoming is found I. e. Only two slot exist not for memory card. With sd card we can use only one sim card. But both sims have same importance.
