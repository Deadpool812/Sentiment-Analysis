Super Moto G 5G
It has network problems. Calls are getting disconnected very frequently and also seen voice drop down. How come a 5g mobile has issues with 4g network.
"A good buy in this price, people who  want a 5G phone in this budget."
Love motorola. Yes it's does not have amoled screen. But it's good screen. Clean ui. Battery last 1.5 days with mid usage. Over all value for money. With clean ui nd 5g. Batter than mi nd realme. It take 1.2-1.6 hours for full charging. 
I have been using it moderately for over a week and have been quite satisfied with its performance-
Best mobile. Go for it....
Full two days battery backup. Fine camera. Easy to use.
Good phone at RS 19K
Network issues are there...m
Nice mobile on 5G
Overall very good phone with high performance SD750g  And 5g . gaming performance also very good.if high refresh rate is there will better..but in daily used not that much noticeable..camera also good.. battery backup also üëå.after heavy gaming only 10-12% battery down. Call of duty runs at veryhigh graphic with adreno 619 ..( 750g almost same as 765g)
"Great phone, superb, underrated"
It could be way better I am a asus fan boy. But stock android experience is top notch. I usually worried about durability of the phone. This is good in durability üëç
Great mobile. Most buy if any one looking 20000 rs mobile
It's voice quality is very bad plz assist
Good
"The mobile is taking about three hours to fully charge. Both the mobile and the charger are heating up while charging the mobile.The battery is running for 13 to 14 hours on full charge.The sound is not heard clearly while talking. As the video playing, the display light is automatically getting low."
No headset and average build quality and a bit heavy n bulky
Good phone but disappointed with the camera below average
Poor battery back-up don't buy it.
Awesome phone

Nice mobile phone
Nice phone
Features looks good in Paper but actual performance is not up to the mark.
Motorola Moto G 5G is powered by an octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 750G processor. It comes with 4GB of RAM. The Motorola Moto G 5G runs Android 10 and is powered by a 5000mAh battery.
Lovely
Camera: 
Performance wise good enough but price wise too high
Camera quality it good at outdoor
Wonderful
"Guys, I am the big fan of  Motorola. I am using from MOTO G 1st Gen  to MOTO G5 PLUS. All My family members using to Moto. Now a days, Moto is getting problem.."
Network issue nd too much heavier.
"The phone is good and this buy is an upgrade from moto g5s plus, so I have no issues apart from the hybrid sim slot and phone body. "
"This phone is amazing, but if display is amoled or super amoled with minimum 90 hz refresh rate then the phone becomes excellent"
Very nice
"This is my second Motorola phone after Moto G5 Plus. Motorola lovers will definitely love this phone. This phone is for those want clean user interface (Stock Android), reliable performance and Motorola's unique gestures."
"It's been a month, I am using this phone and I am disappointed overall. "
Good mobile

Amazing Phone..
Poor 4g network reception. Noise in photos captured through device camera. Good processor but network reception is more important which is not good.
Best mobile on this price

Network issues are there...m
Nice mobile on 5G
Decent Phone better than one plus nord but ram may be increased in future
"Product is decent, not that great according to price."
Performance of this phone is really amazing. Every function of this phone is performing well but there are more noises in the dark mode photo capturing by rear and front camera..
By seeing 1&2 star reviews it took time to decided whether to go for it or not 
good
For that amount product is not that good as compare thier competers
Mobile create voice drop problem at time calling
Camera quality not good.
Average phone on this budget
Awesome mobile.
"All good in this budget, we are expecting inbuilt voice recorder which is not available, rest is good"
Good phone at this price
Worth of money

Network issue nd hanging
Worst quality of phone. Camera quality is very bad. Once u buy it u will stuck with it. Even there is no replacement option. They say but they won't respond u properly.
Nice phone with strong hardware and superior voice quality. Performance also top class. Easy to handle and good battery life. Only concern is weight
Good in that price cut

Heavy phone camera is not great
Mindblowing 5G Mobile in this price range in India. At last I suggest everyone to buy this mobile.

Disgusting camera
Excellent product in low price most recommended
Good phone. I like this phone
Good camara good battery
Good display
Expected alot but poor performance
Very good
Personally superb Phone but a little bit awkward when I see the pixel density is too low in high resolution and big display. But that's okay. All is good to go for this price segment.
One of best 5G phone in mid range. Excellent speed.. value for money. I will definitely recommend this phone.
Good device!!
Some what big size but everything is fine.
1.Very poor network connectivity in any network even if you are side of network tower then also you will never get full network.
"I was So excited to buy any 5 g phone ,, n was Looking for on internet ,,then fainally moto g 5 g intered into heart with India's most affordable 5 g phone with awesome quality n experience "
A single word ASOME PHONE
Good phone except for some improvements required in camera focus department. Close quarter photo struggles for focus fixing. Night time photos loose sharpness. Rest is good.
Worst product. Dont buy any electronic related things from flipcart. They just cheat the customer. recevied the mobile but its getting heated. And now flipcart is not resolving the issue.The just give N number of reasons to reject the replacement
"Review after one week usage - Amazing performance, clean android experience and  perfect build quality. Missing AMOLED SCREEN DISPLAY at this price tag. But, display performance is up to mark even though it's not AMOLED."
Love it
Except for the weight liked everything about the Motog 5G.
It doesn't heat up on regular game play for 2 3 hours.
My experience with this is very good. Best affordable phone with many features that are not available in this budget phons.
Great phone by Moto üéâ I am the long user of moto just an awesome feeling
Detailed review after using 1 week:
Best Motorola phone
The front camera quality is bad..mainly software.....one cannot change whatsapp default camera option.
Superb excellent phone buy like this product
At this price this phone is great but one thing is missing 120hz or 90hz display.
good mobile
Good but prices are very high
Nice Phone
Very powerful performance in all departments I would strongly suggest must buy it what a amazing 5 G phone on budget well done moto .... !!!
Camera clarity is not good.
It is definitely the best value for money in this price. With an assured upgrade to Android 11 and 5G this will easily last for more than 2 years without any major problems.
The product is very heavy
I will summarise my review in pros & cons with 3 days of usage:
This device is value for money with price less than 20k. Only thing that can be improved is camera app features (and have one like Pixel camera app or Mi camera app)
Very good phone
The mobile is ok ok for me it has battery heating problem and some bugs also sometime some apps doesn't respond properly otherwise it's ok good phone but not better nor best u can buy this if u r not a hardcore gamer
Overall rating: 3.8/5
"Internet network is very very slow, do not buy this mobile, totally money waste, network not working"
"Best 5g phone at this price,great i will recommend this to all,.üëåüëåüëåüëå"
"Nice (& big) display, "
Sounds great
It's really osm go for it 5star
Very nice product selfie camera is very good 
Screencast Connection with TV without Chromecast is not possible. While Nord it's connecting
"Bought the Frosted Silver mobile on launch date for 20K, as a marriage gift for my Sister-In-Law."
Good mobile
Best phone .
Owsame
"Phone is heavy, battery moderate, screen also long"
As of now looking very good. Natural photos no extra filters added. Liked the 0.5* zoom(wide angle)
Good in budget 5G phone..Camera is also very good and with excellent performance.
Best budget friendly mobile in this segment.
"Phone software problem, extra ordinary 5g. Overall not bad"
Power packed becz itz motorola ‚ù§Ô∏è
"I really don't want to buy a Chinese product, I waited for like 2 months for micromax but they didn't release their mid range yet. So about this mobile it's performance is great like honestly great, camera is good in day light but sucks at night, battery is also good, the only thing is it's display which is also nice but it'll be better if they used Amoled or atleast 90hz."
I purchased first time online cell phone from Flip cart but my experience is too bad a very poor service and quality of this phone is not good as expected there is heating problem in phone . And camera and sound quality during call is not good .
Value for money product very good performance go for it.
I like it
"Poor network reception, bulky phone with less value for money. No call recording options."
Good camera
"Hello, I am repeatedly asking to return the mobile to Flipkart.  But Flipkart gives the option to replace it deliberately by not refunding.  You are also getting upset by this and I am also getting upset.                                                                                 "
Battery capacity is superb camera ok screen resolution should be better
"I bought this mobile after I used iphone se for past 3 years. Due to iphone user, I can't rate this mobile for sure. I don't know it is usual that camera has less quality than iphone compared with Android. In moto g 5g, I have seen only the issue with camera clarity. Other than that, it is an awesome mobile phone. Before buying this mobile, my expectation was high. It satisfied me to give overall 4 stars for now as a 1 week user. I may give extra star after some time if I get better signal st..."
My review on this is as follows:
I really like this phone 
Very very happy üòÇ
Waste of money
Best in this price
Value for money
Purchased as gift for wife.
Not as expected
Record video for more than 5 minutes and see the time it takes to process. Processing time of camera is very very slow.
A bit disappointed with camera but rest all is awesome üòé
Nice phone
As a Motorola phone user from Moto G3 then Moto G5 plus then this 5G phone. I like these phones since Motorola was American company. But now it is also a Chinese Lenovo but expect development is american and mfd in India.
Very bad camera experience..but display...touch...processor is good.
Excellent phone in this price
"It's more or less like a average phone don't value this much, camera is very bad, not even like a 10k phone"
Well & useful 
"Good product, till now phone is working better, little bit more  weighted"
Some what big size but everything is fine.
1.Very poor network connectivity in any network even if you are side of network tower then also you will never get full network.
"Product is good but packing is not at all good. Moto company need to work even more on camera for night vision, atleast they could have use ips Lcd display instead of ltps display. Apart from that looks everything fine."
Super price super mobile
Worth for money
"Sim slot unable to insert properly,. Horrible,. Manufacturing deffect"
Very nice Phone
After using for 2weeks Its a good allrounder phone nothing is Less in this...still now no issue and bulit in quality of phone is good.. worth to buy...go moto
It is ok Moto phone... Comparatively high prices based on configuration & look.
Good phone. Will provide more update once I will use the phone.
This phone is amazing you can get the 5g phone in very lowest price performance is good and there are many gesture this can help you to  make your smartphone easier.
I've had the same router for 3-4 years and have changed 2 mobile handsets but never faced continuous disruption in the WiFi connection like it is happening right now with this handset. Everything else is fine. WiFi issue needs to be fixed asap!!
Good
Good phone with seemless performance. Excellent battery back up for atleast 2 days. Satisfied for past one weeks of usage. Thanks Flipkart for selling a geniune product..
Superb phone... Value for money üî•üíïü§©
"Avg display,low light photos are avg, bulky luk."
"good 5G mobile ,cheapest mobile in India 5G, ::Moto G 5G"
There is no video calling facility being high end 5g mobile
Little bit weight..but mobile is good with sleek UI.nice performance..
"Poor display, colour reproduction terrible as if viewing a sepia or a faded picture, camera not good, colour, details of photos very poor , as if we are colour blind to red and green colours"
Value for money
Purchased as gift for wife.
"I have shifted to moto g 5g from my favourite moto g4 plus. This 5g phone is cheapest 5g phone currently available, so don't compare it with luxury phones. The price is little higher side compare to 730g processor phones, due to 5g feature and latest 750g processor. But trust me this phone will not desopoint you, if your expectations are not too high. For most of people this phone will satisfy their day to day requirements. "
"A better experience with Moto after having it. The Look & the performance is superb. Battery, secondary camera & body look is satisfactory. But with this price if you want to have faith with a reputed brand then go for it."
Display 4.5/5
Poor battery backup does not last even for one complete day
Best smart phone in 2020
Overall a great 5G phone in this budget. Performance and Battery is great. Display and Camera could have been better. 
It's A very cool phone nice product I am very happy to buy this phone I will sugest everyone to buy this
"It is good phone, big one, little heavy in hand but comfortable to hold. camera is good, lacks inbuilt dual app feature even when it is dual sim phone. But it is worth at price if 5G comes soon. Can‚Äôt use memory card if you are using 2 sims."
Nice mobile
Very poor phone wastage of money screen display is like phone under 5 thousand and it's look is also dull
"In this budget it is a good phone. Cheapest 5g phone at the moment in India. And for average users it is the best and if you think it is not good enough go for OnePlus nord, and One plus 8 or Vivo. But for that you have to invest more 8-15 thausand rupees."
Not performing as expected camera also poor quality less features network working very slow
A good device from Motorola. 
Great product go for it .
"Very good mobile phone, value of money. Easy to use."
On first it's battery gave good service and after first its battery drain little bit early than without charging i mean new phone 
Camera quality is loww and sim try is soft and don't perfact fit sim card properly gallery apps convrt to google photos notification settings is very difficult to use don't buy flipkart not refund any issues
Average

Excellent mobile and delivered on time. Really appreciate delivery agent support and politeness

Nice mobile with good features at this segment...
Let me provide my review after 1 week of use.

Quality product
Worst mobile in this range 
"It is one of the Great smartphone Launched by Motorola, Everyone should go through it"
Great phone.
The only problem is it took 2.5 hrs to get full charge.... 
Was using Asus flagship phone for last three years and I loved to use stock android. Motorola has full filed my expectations with 5g support. G 5g is quite impressive regarding performance. I am not big fan of games or camera so performance wise it's good.
Phone size is okay as per current available mobiles.
Work on display
"Phone is good to operate, but moto should give wirless charging and infrared. Although camera at this price rate tag is not up to date and should change the screen."
Good products
Great Mobile

avg phone
"Ok, first 5G phone in my bag."
Great product
If u need a budget 5G phone everything your highlight is only performance and battery then go for it...
Nice phone given this price range. Screen guard not provided in the box and refresh rate could have been higher else excellent.
Worth of money.
Love it
"Great camera, good sound"
"Moto G 5G - Performance and functions are really great. camera, touch screen and sound s awesome !!"
Nothing extra ordinary other than 5G. Don't go with this Mobile only for 5G.
Clean stock android
Phone is good expect problem In gaming due to bezzel of front camera.. phone ks awesome and a perfect buy.. apart from unresponsive to touch near front camera and a better screen refresh rate all is best packed.
Yday received phone and this is my first Motorola device
Just awesome...... Got the delivery even faster than expected.... The phone is just lit..... Best value for money phone in the present time market.... Thanks Flipkart

Delivery was fast and delivery boy was very polite. He waited for half an hour to allow me to clear my old phone.
Nice phone
Flipcart delivery good..but phone is not worth of the money.. display is not good..cemara colours...not Bright..some times.. improvement be must next update..
Nice phone with much powerful procy. Games like Pubg is running smoothly without lag.

This is my honnest review and I would like to say only one word ossom‚ù§Ô∏è
Cheapest 5G all band smartphone & super fast delivery from Flipkart. I received the product within 12hrs. WOW!!
Loving this phone and Flipkart's quick and efficient delivery.
Day 1 Review :
"Nice power pack from Moto,A must buy."
"Product was delivered ontime. Performance is very good. Average camera. Pure android experience. My opinion price is worth. Too heavy, average refresh rate and sound quality is low are its cons."
"Refresh rate is low, should have been atleast 90. You would definately find the slowness."
overall phone is amazing
my 5th motorola phone ü§©ü§©
Unbelievable...
"Perfect and clean mobile, but refresh rate should have been bit higher than 60hz"
Good display
Better phone but it's price not worth it
"Motorola You Made my year i bought Moto One Fusion Plus for sis, Moto G9 for Dad, Moto e7 Plus for Mom and finally Moto G 5g for me Thanks all Motorola for making 2020 a great year for Motorola.. and its fans... It is complete future proof smartphone. 5g Ready first member in my family with 5g connectivity. Hoping 5g will roll out soon."
"Very nice Mobile in this price segment, "
"5g mobile in least amount......since reliance announced 5g network in next year, therefore future mobile in least price.."
"Good and smooth display, all type of network available good performance of this phone"
Pure android . Touch is not smooth. Speaker sound is low. No native call recording . No native screen recording A bit heavy. Camera is average only
"I'm using OnePlus nord but i don't like the display (tint on display is not a issue according to OnePlus üòî), camera and battery drain on OnePlus nord..so now i switched to moto g 5g..i feel like this is much flagship level phone with good camera and fast performance..Go For it you will future proof atleast 2 years with 5g supported..so thanks moto ü•∞"
If you only want good processor then this phone is best otherwise it is not worth of buying less features as compared to other phone in the same price range. Camera is worst. Shift from chiness brand this phone not even nearer to that
Best performance in budget üî•
"Camara good,  speed ok n Screen guard not given"
"Very nice phone especially the display is awesome and much better than other brands, that's why I love Moto, but camera is not as good as that of Samsung"
This phone is awesome which comes with a smooth experience.
